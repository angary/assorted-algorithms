# Assorted Algorithms

A bunch of algorithms that I decided to showcase. If I'm currently working on something at the moment, the most recent commit will be in the dev branch.

## matrix factorisation

**[Link](matrix_factorisation) | Dec 2020**

**A matrix factorisation algorithm such as those used in recommendation systems.**</br>
A latent matrix factorisation algorithm through gradient descent.

## reversi

**[Link](reversi) | Oct 2020**

**A command line implementation of the board game 'Reversi' along with an AI to play against.**

Algorithms used: minimax, move sorting, alpha beta pruning, transposition table, and zobrist keys. Heuristics used: mobility, corners captured, frontier length, stability, and predetermined value of square.

## markov chain text

**[Link](markov_chain_text.py) | Sep 2020**

**Reads text file, and generates a new piece of text using the same immediate word probabilities.**

Generates graph of words from given text. New text is generated through markov chain, where the next word chosen is based off the current word and original text's probabilistic rules.

## magic knights tour

**[Link](magic_knights_tour.py) | Aug 2020**

**Generates magic knights tour given any starting point.**

Uses a recursive backtracking solve involving regular quartes, Warnsdorff's heuristic and quad backtracking.

## true false practise

**[Link](<true false practise.py>) | Oct 2019**

First piece of code I uploaded to github in this previously private repo, held here for SenTimEnTaL vAluE.
